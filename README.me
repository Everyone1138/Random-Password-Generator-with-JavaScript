to better define their new password criteria. The user can then select the criteria through a series of prompts of which the user can click
the OK button to agree to the addition of the criteria to their new password. Or they can hit the cancel button to remove that criteria from their
new password. The lenght of the password can be between 8 and 128 characters. The user has the option of choosing special characters or not to be included in their new password.
